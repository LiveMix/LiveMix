Installation
------------


To install JackMix you basicly need to do:
 scons configure
 scons

JackMix requires Qt4.2 or higher and the jack-audio-connection-kit version 0.100.0 or higher.

If you want to install JackMix into some other dir than the default, please add "prefix=<path>" to the "scons configure".

If you Qt4 is install into /usr and libs are under /usr/lib/qt4 and headers in /usr/include/qt4 you need to have a configure call like this:

 QTDIR=/usr scons configure qtlibs=/usr/lib/qt4

If you run into any other problems don't hesitate to contact me at arnold@arnoldarts.de or on linux-audio-user@lists.linuxaudio.org.
